/* Set
A Set is a container that allows us to store elements
following the property:

  - Elements NEVER repeat, they are always unique.

To ensure that the element does not exist, we must check all previously 
inserted elements. Using a linked list would be very costly since we cannot
avoid traversing every single element.

To facilitate this task, we rely on a classic data structure called 
"Binary Search Tree" or BST. This structure helps reduce the search space for 
an element since only the branches that are likely to lead to it are traversed.
